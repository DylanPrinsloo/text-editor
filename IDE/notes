This is only for my personal notes on how to build the enviroment.
These notes will need an update, used a paper based notes for the project. 
updated 2024/10/05

Ctrl-V == 22 byte && Ctrl-0 == 15 byte

Ctrl-M == 10 , shoudl =! 10, Needs to be 13. 
Ctrl-J == 10
Enter key == 10

keys have been added, case = numbers

ICRNL: CR == carriage return

we translate newlines ("\n") into carriages, returns ("\r\n")
cursor is moved.

OPOST is output flag, post translates to "post-proccesing of output"

BRKINT ""
INPCK ""
ISTRIP ""
CS8 ""


snprintf() comes from <stdio.h>.

We use the welcome buffer and snprintf() to interpolate our KILO_VERSION string into the welcome message. 
We also truncate the length of the string 
in case the terminal is too tiny to fit our welcome message.

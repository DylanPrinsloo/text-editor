The first is to understand that it will be a complex project, 
but this is what i would do. First is list all the features that you want the IDE to have, every single feature (starting with the most important). 
Following that, divide the features into categories, you are going to have a user interface, a code editor, some sort of compiler and a way to do debugging. 
You also need to decide programming language/s it will support. Then you need to select the programming language. 
you can use python if you like but you could also use something else like JAVA. You can make this decision based on what the features are. 
Next you need to decide on an architecture, how do you want to structure it. Because it will consist of many "parts" consider dividing it into components and 
each of those are developed separately, alternatively you could use micorservices. I would suggest you research if there are any already existing open source 
IDE's that you could just modify to have the security features you want. Reuse would be ideal in this situation because you just need a standard IDE and then 
add security to that
 
In summary, you need to list all that the application must do
Divide the features into groups or "components"
Decide on an architecture
Decide on a language and framework (based on the features)
Decide on a design methodology, considering reuse as that might be the fastest approach.

Once you have of this information it will then become much more clearer. You can then decide from there on and create a project plan
